        <p class="hello-description">
          I am a final year Computer Science student at IEM, Kolkata. I have a passion for Programming and Problem-Solving. I have been active on platforms like <a class="coding-profile" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/shubho5das"> Codeforces</a>, <a class="coding-profile" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/sd05">Codechef</a>, <a class="coding-profile" href="https://leetcode.com/shubho5das/">Leetcode</a> where I have solved over 1200 coding problems. Since the last few weeks, I've also been trying my hand in Web Development <em>(that's the reason you can view this website xD).</em> <br><br>
          In my free time I enjoy playing table tennis and reading storybooks. I'm also a massive Real Madrid supporter and love following their matches during the weekend.

          <h3>Algorithmic Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>I enjoy spending hours immersed in the world of coding problems. Over the past few years, I have developed a sound knowledge of <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong> and love applying it to solve a given problem in an optimal and elegant way.  </p>

              Describe my CP Journey. Started from 2nd Year Summer Break - after learning C in 1st Year. My defining poing of the pandemic - helped me spend my time staying at home for 2 years.
              The feeling Adrenalinse Rush is crazy... When struggling with a problem for hours, and then finally securing AC, the feelng of satisfaction is unreal. There's so much Dopamine Relase after each green tick.
              Ups and downs.
              Provide links to my CP Handles. Leetcode: <link> CF: <link /> CC: <link:sd05>      (early Septemebr)

              - Try keeping it brief. 2-3 lines. No boring people. (20/9/22)
              - Reduce font size, if needed. But make sure, the font appraears exatly to the side of the image. (20/9/22)

          <p>I am currently doing a Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. <!--(and I'm totally loving it!).-->I have covered the concepts of <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong> so far.
            Would cover the remaining concepts in the next few months.</p>
          <!--
           - Have < 4o words, so that the text nicely fits inside 4 lines and looks nice. Also I want the Reader to take no more than 10 secs to read thorugh it (Time to reed - Grammarly Insight)
           -  Try to sound/be as honest and genuine as I can be. No showboating or exagerrating (this is not my resume) - be totally transparant nd confident. (27/9/22)

           - Keep updating the list as I cover more concepts
             "I have covered the concepts of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and jQuery so far."

      <!-- Note:
           - Have a cool coffee image - like Mahak Didi's? Or leave it for now. Keep it minimalistic - Angela Yu + Sean Halpin style.
           - Make the phone no: red - to appear prominent
           - Content: See db's, mahak's or some other format. Stay real - I'm not really into projects, so drop the idea about projects for the time being. (13/9/22)

           - In the contact me button, redirect to a form (having "send" button insted of "contacc me" button) instead of mailTo.  Reference: https://sonusourav.github.io/  (13/9/22)
           - For the "contact me" button, have the title as "message me" instead of "contact me". Sounds smarter. Sean Halpin style B)
           -
           - Don't have "Feel free to text/call me..." and provide my phone no. I don't really want random people calling me on my personal phone no., do I? (23/9)
